            <p>
        I am a <b> tenacious, meticulous, and fun-loving </b> person who just enjoys everthing tech. <br> 
        
        I am a proud graduate of the following institutions: <br><br>
        <ul> 
            <li>  UWI Mona School of Data, where I studied Data Fundamentals</li>
          <br>  <li> University of Technology, Jamaica , where I have a Bachelors' Degree in Pharmacy</li>
          <br>  <li> St. Hilda's High </li> 
        </ul>
       <br><br> I love singing and dancing in my spare time and <strong> yes, </strong>I love playing video games. 
        <br> <br>I am a Pharmacist, but I am looking forward to spreading my wings in the Technology industry. </br>
        <br> My philosophy states that <i> with God, all things are possible. </i> <br>
       
       <br> As the Right Excellent, Marcus Mosiah Garvey says,<i> <q> A man without knowledge of it's past history, origin and culture, <br> 
            is like a tree without roots </q> </i>
        <br> <br>   I am from the beautiful garden parish of St. Ann, Jamaica but currently reside in the parish of St. Mary. </p>
