        I am a <b> tenacious, meticulous, and fun-loving </b> person who just enjoys everthing tech. <br> 
        
        I am a proud graduate of the following institutions: </p> <br><br>

       <br><br> <p> I love singing and dancing in my spare time and <strong> yes, </strong>I love playing video games.
