        <p>Arsenal Football Club was established in 1886 by a group of munitions workers looking to build a community away from their challenging work in the Woolwich Armaments factory. From those humble beginnings, we now reach millions of supporters around the world. We have pioneered the game at all levels through the ages, from our ground-breaking teams of the 1930s and 2000s, to establishing what has become the most successful women’s team in history in 1987 and providing community programmes to thousands of people in our local boroughs and beyond.</p>
        <p>That commitment to succeed and innovate is as strong today as it has been throughout our history. Our stated purpose is very clear: “Arsenal Acts for a winning team, culture and community.” We have exciting plans to make this happen across everything we do on and off the pitch. </p>
        <p>Arsenal was the first club from the South of England to join the Football League in 1893, and they reached the First Division in 1904. Relegated only once, in 1913, they continue the longest streak in the top division, and have won the second-most top-flight matches in English football history. In the 1930s, Arsenal won five League Championships and two FA Cups, and another FA Cup and two Championships after the war. In 1970–71, they won their first League and FA Cup Double. Between 1989 and 2005, they won five League titles and five FA Cups, including two more Doubles. They completed the 20th century with the highest average league position. Between 1998 and 2017, Arsenal qualified for the UEFA Champions League for nineteen consecutive seasons.</p>
